Main objective is to reduce risk of electrolyte thermal precipitation and hydrogen evolution which could lead to fire and explosion if not monitored. Too high or too low temperatures may cause irreversible precipitation of Vanadium species in the VRFB cell leading to energy losses. 
Control parameter: Electrolyte temperature

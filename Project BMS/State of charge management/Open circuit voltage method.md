Open circuit voltage is the potential difference between positive and negative terminals of the battery when it is disconnected from any external load or current.  It depends on the concentration and activity of the vanadium ions in each half cell, temperature and pressure of the system. 

Based on the relation between Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) and SOC.

Uoc = f (SOC)
the values can be determined using through charge discharge fitting experiment of the battery.

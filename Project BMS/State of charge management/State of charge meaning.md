It is the amount of energy stored in the battery at a given time typically expressed as percentage. It represents the remaining capacity of the battery relative to its maximum capacity. 
SOC = Qc/ Q * 100
Qc is the current remaining 
Q is the battery capacity available (usually rated capacity is taken) - electric charge quantity residual power.. unit is A.h

Ways to determine SOC
- Traditional battery experiment methods 
- Modern methods based on control theory especially intelligent algorithms
